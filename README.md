# Hi, I’m Lisa. | Governed AI Strategist

I specialize in **Disciplined AI Execution**: the bridge between raw data diagnostics and autonomous operational systems. I help organizations move past AI hype by engineering high-integrity frameworks that ensure automation is **auditable, reversible, and ROI-aligned.**

### ⭐ Strategic Intent
To architect governed AI ecosystems for high-stakes environments where data integrity is the primary constraint and ROI is the mandatory output.
To architect governed AI ecosystems for high-stakes environments (Legal, Advancement, ITSM) where data integrity is non-negotiable.

### 🛠️ The Governed Framework
I approach every project through a three-stage **Sovereignty Model**:
* **Offer A | Workflow Diagnostics:** Mapping end-to-end processes and establishing 30-day performance baselines.
* **Offer B | Controls & Integrity:** Designing "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) guardrails and automated reconciliation unit tests.
* **Offer C | Agentic Architecture:** Deploying platform-agnostic AI Agents that prioritize "Source-of-Truth" logic over generative hallucinations.

### 📊 Featured Case: [https://github.com/lisa-villanueva/itsm-workflow-sql-diagnostics]
* **The Insight:** Identified a **45% SLA performance penalty** tied to process "Rework."
* **The Solution:** Engineered a **Socratic Diagnostic Agent** to triage high-friction tickets.
